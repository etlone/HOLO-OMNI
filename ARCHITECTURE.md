## Component Details

### Client Layer
- **Game UI/UX**: React-based user interface with Three.js for 3D rendering
- **React/Three.js Client**: Main game client handling rendering and user input
- **Web3 Wallet Connection**: Integration with MetaMask and other Web3 wallets

### Game Engine Layer
- **Physics Engine**: Handles movement, collisions, and environmental interactions
- **Rendering Engine**: Three.js-based rendering system for game visuals
- **Animation Engine**: Manages character and environmental animations
- **Particle System**: Handles visual effects for auras, energy, and interactions

### Core Services
- **Game State Service**: Central state management using Redux/MobX
- **Network Sync Service**: Real-time multiplayer synchronization
- **Event System**: Handles game events, achievements, and interactions
- **Achievement Service**: Tracks and manages player/community achievements

### Health Integration Layer
- **Health Data Service**: Central health data processing and management
- **Wearable Integration**: Connects with various health tracking devices
- **Biometric Processing**: Processes and analyzes health metrics
- **Health Visualization**: Transforms health data into visual elements

### Blockchain Layer
- **Smart Contracts**: Manages tokens, governance, and data ownership
- **Token Management**: Handles $HLTH tokens and SBTs
- **DAO Governance**: Implements community governance mechanisms
- **Data Vaults**: Secure storage for sensitive health data

### External Systems
- **Blockchain Networks**: Connection to Ethereum/other chains
- **Wearable Devices**: Integration with health tracking devices
- **Health Systems**: Connection to external health data providers

## Data Flow Examples

### Health Data Flow
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant WD as Wearable Device
    participant HI as Health Integration
    participant GS as Game State
    participant VE as Visual Engine
    
    WD->>HI: Send health metrics
    HI->>GS: Process & update state
    GS->>VE: Transform data
    VE->>VE: Update visuals
```

### Player Interaction Flow
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant P1 as Player 1
    participant NS as Network Sync
    participant GS as Game State
    participant P2 as Player 2
    
    P1->>NS: Initiate gesture
    NS->>GS: Update state
    GS->>NS: Broadcast update
    NS->>P2: Sync gesture
```

### Token Transaction Flow
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant U as User
    participant W as Web3 Wallet
    participant SC as Smart Contract
    participant GS as Game State
    
    U->>W: Initiate transaction
    W->>SC: Execute contract
    SC->>GS: Update game state
    GS->>U: Update UI
```

## Scaling Considerations

### Horizontal Scaling
```mermaid
graph LR
    LB[Load Balancer]
    LB --> S1[Server 1]
    LB --> S2[Server 2]
    LB --> S3[Server 3]
    S1 --> DB[(Database)]
    S2 --> DB
    S3 --> DB
```

### Data Sharding
```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph Shard 1
        D1[(Game Data)]
    end
    subgraph Shard 2
        D2[(Health Data)]
    end
    subgraph Shard 3
        D3[(Token Data)]
    end
```

This architecture emphasizes:
1. Modular design for easy scaling
2. Clear separation of concerns
3. Secure health data handling
4. Real-time game state management
5. Efficient blockchain integration
6. Scalable multiplayer support
